**Theseus Services** is a content mod providing a number of assets for Arma 3, aimed at Private Military Company game style, developed around the needs of [Theseus Incorporated](http://www.theseus-aegis.com) community. Starting out as a mod by *Pomigit*, then maintained by *BadHabitz* with a number of other community developers contributing, it is a re-brand of a highly successful **PG Services** mod.

The project is entirely **open-source** and all contributions are welcome. Feel free to maintain your own custom version, so long as the changes you make are open to the public in accordance with the GNU General Public License ([GPLv2](https://github.com/Theseus-Aegis/TheseusServices/blob/master/LICENSE)).
